This project was made in collaboration with one other student at Greenville Tech, Joshua Everhart, as our senior design project. The requirement was to showcase our ability to put together a website coded in PHP, JavaScript (jQuery), and HTML/CSS with a call to a database. The website and database were built from scratch - we did not use any framework or pre-existing code, which is sometimes the case with schoolwork assignments.

We took it upon ourselves to go further than what the requirements called for. Using the Bootstrap framework, we built a mobile-friendly website in PHP from the ground up. Bootstrap was very fun and easy to use - though I know how to code HTML/CSS, Bootstrap was much preferrable for formatting and style when the main focus was on building functionality.

The database did not have to be created by us - however, we chose to do so, as building databases is fun! SQL is probably my favority language to code in (MySQL).

As part of the project, we also had to provide documentation on various aspects of the project (e.g. functional specs, timelines, change orders, etc.), as well as a 10-minute presentation/demonstration at the end of the semester to the professor and students in the class. We got an (almost) perfect score!
